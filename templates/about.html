      <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        We are a team passionate about solving real-world problems in manufacturing using the power of artificial
        intelligence. Our project, <strong>Enhancing Product Reliability</strong>, focuses on automating the detection
        of casting defects using deep learning.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">The Problem</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Casting is a widely used manufacturing process where molten material is poured into a mold to form a desired
        shape. However, this process is prone to defects such as blow holes, pinholes, burrs, shrinkage cavities, and
        metallurgical inconsistencies. These defects can compromise product quality and lead to costly rejections.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Most industries rely on manual inspection to detect these flaws. This process is slow, labor-intensive, and not
        always accurate. Even a small oversight can result in the rejection of an entire batch, causing significant
        financial loss.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">Our Motivation</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        I am part of a team in the casting industry. I'm trying to ensure that every product we ship is free from
        defects, but our current inspection process is manual and inconsistent, because it relies on human judgment,
        which is time-consuming and prone to error — which makes me feel frustrated and worried about costly rejections
        and production delays.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">Our Solution</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        To address this, we developed a deep learning model using transfer learning with the VGG16 architecture. This
        model is trained to classify casting products as either defective or good based on image data. By integrating
        this model into a web application, we provide a simple and efficient tool for automated quality inspection.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Our goal is to reduce inspection time, improve accuracy, and help manufacturers maintain high standards of
        product reliability — all while minimizing waste and cost.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">Technology Stack</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        <li>Python & Flask for backend development</li>
        <li>TensorFlow and Keras for deep learning and transfer learning</li>
        <li>VGG16 pre-trained model for image classification</li>
        <li>Tailwind CSS for responsive and modern UI design</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-6">
        We believe that combining AI with practical manufacturing needs can lead to smarter, faster, and more reliable
        production processes.
